synopsis: "Library to provide Erlang style distributed computations. This library is inspired by Cloud Haskell"

description: """
Primitive for spawning processes (in the Erlang sense) either remotely or locally, monitoring/unmonitoring spawned processes, sending, 
receiving, broadcasting messages to those processes. Unlike Erlang, the messages that are sent between processes are typed.
